# What is this ?

After the official AssetStudio by Razmoth was discontinued, bugs started to arise as games evolved, and people started making forks to fix some of them, but each one would not support the fixes by the others and so on. This version aims at being the new start base for AssetStudio, renamed as AnimeStudio, it supports all 3 main hoyo games, and is open to any contribution !

# What's changed ?

This is a non-exhaustive list of modifications :
- Merged fixes for Genshin, Star Rail and ZZZ suport
- Dark mode
- Reorganised menu bar for easier usage
- Asset Browser improvements
    - It is now possible to use json files instead of only message pack
    - You can now relocate the sources files of a map instead of having to build a new one to adjust them, making maps no longer game install dir dependant
    - Only selected assets are displayed in the main window when loading instead of the full blocks

# How to use ?

Compared to the original studio, the UI was slightly adjusted, but if you are familiar with AssetStudio, you should get the hang of it very quickly. For new people, there is not a tutorial for this one specifically yet, but I recommend looking at the original tutorial to help [here](https://gist.github.com/Modder4869/0f5371f8879607eb95b8e63badca227e) (Tutorial by Modder4869) and look at the [original readme](https://github.com/RazTools/Studio/blob/main/README.md), otherwise you can ask in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/fzRdtVh).

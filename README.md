# What is this ?

After the official AssetStudio by Razmoth was discontinued, bugs started to arise as games evolved, and people started making forks to fix some of them, but each one would not support the fixes by the others and so on. This version aims at being the new start base for AssetStudio, renamed as AnimeStudio, it supports all 3 main hoyo games, and is open to any contribution !

# How to use ?

Compared to the original studio, the UI was slightly adjusted, but if you are familiar with AssetStudio, you should get the hang of it very quickly. For new people, there is not a tutorial for this one specifically yet, but I recommend looking at the original tutorial by Modder4869 to help [here](https://gist.github.com/Modder4869/0f5371f8879607eb95b8e63badca227e) (Make sure to download from this page and not using the link on the tutorial page !!) and look at the [original readme](https://github.com/RazTools/Studio/blob/main/README.md), otherwise you can ask in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/fzRdtVh).
